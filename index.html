    <h3>Objective: Develop a simulation of a robot swarm exploring and mapping the Martian surface.</h3>
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>The exploration and mapping of Mars present significant challenges due to the planet's vast, rugged terrain and
      harsh
      environmental conditions. Traditional single-rover missions, while valuable, are limited in their scope and
      efficiency. The first being slow progress: careful navigation and the need to avoid hazards mean that single
      rovers
      often progress slowly, limiting the amount of terrain they can explore.</p>
    <p>The distance between Earth and Mars results in significant communication delays, ranging from 4 to 24 minutes
      one-way. This delay makes real-time control impossible and complicates problem-solving during critical mission
      phases. Another issue is a lack of redundancy: if a single rover fails or gets stuck, the entire mission is
      jeopardized.
      </p>
    <p>To address these limitations and accelerate Martian exploration, we propose the development of a simulation
      system for a flying robot swarm designed to explore and map the Martian surface. Building upon NASA's innovative
      Marsbee concept, our simulation project aims to extend and refine the swarm exploration approach for Mars. From
      the
      Marsbee concept, the algorithm will implement resilient system design, emphasizing the robustness of the swarm to
      individual unit failures, and collaborative data collection, implementing algorithms for single and collaborative
      sample
      or
      data collection missions among swarm members.</p>

      <h3>Swarm Behavior</h3>
      <p>Implement basic swarm intelligence algorithms:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Collision avoidance with terrain features and other robots: </p>
          <p>The swarm will have inter-communication methods that broadcasts each of their positions relative to the rover</p>
        <li>Each member of the swarm is equipped with a camera and a lidar sensor for terrain mapping, this can also be utilized for terrain collison detection</li>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The swarm will be given a target point with the origin at the rover. They will from a sphere with the origin at the specified point</p>
          <p>The rover only need to send out a length and a theta (2D sphereical coordinate, a circle coordinate) and the swarm will decide how high they need to be </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Exploration and Mapping Algorithm</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p> Use the lidar and camera to obtain images </p>
        </li>
        <li> either process and compress the data on board, or send raw data depending on mission requirements </li>
        <li> Transmission will be covered in a later section </li>
        <li>
          <p>Implement a method for robots to mark and share information about discovered features.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Visualization</h3>
      <p>We created a basic graphical interface to visualize the swarm's movement and mapping progress on the Martian
        terrain.
      </p>
      <h3>Performance Metrics</h3>
      <p>Implement metrics to measure the swarm's effectiveness:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Percentage of area mapped</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Time to explore key features (e.g., cave entrances)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Efficiency of coverage (avoiding redundant exploration)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
         psuedo code can be found on the github repo https://github.com/RD2P/Simulated-Martian-Swarm-Exploration-and-Mapping
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Communication</h2>
      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      <p>The following outlines the design and requirements for a communication system utilizing Flying Ad-Hoc Networks
        (FANET) to facilitate effective data gathering and transmission back to a rover in a swarm robotics context.</p>

      <h3>2. Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Enable inter-swarm communication.</li>
        <li>Facilitate data gathering and transmission back to the rover.</li>
        <li>Optimize resource usage while ensuring reliable communication.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Requirements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Each member of the swarm must be capable of communication with the rover.</li>
        <li>The system should allow for real-time data transmission and coordination among drones.</li>
        <li>Minimize energy consumption and computational load on each drone.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Motivation</h3>
      <p>Synchronization within the swarm is essential for successful operation. Two primary methods for achieving
        synchronization are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sensory Detection:</strong> Each drone detects nearby obstacles, including other swarm members, and
          actively avoids them. However, this approach is resource-intensive, requiring significant CPU power and energy
          for computer vision algorithms.</li>
        <li><strong>Telecommunication Networks:</strong> Drones can coordinate by calculating their positions relative
          to each other, allowing them to avoid collisions through computational means. While computer vision is still
          necessary for tasks like wall detection, it is less critical for detecting other drones.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>On Mars, communication options are limited to UAV direct communication and UAV communication via ad hoc
        networks.</p>

      <h3>5. Communication Methods</h3>

      <h4>5.1 UAV Direct Communication</h4>
      <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fault tolerance in data transmission.</li>
        <li>Ability to coordinate and distribute tasks in case of member failures.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bandwidth usage increases linearly with swarm size.</li>
        <li>Each member must maintain long-range communication with the rover, leading to higher costs and larger
          battery usage.</li>
        <li>The rover must handle multiple frequencies simultaneously, risking traffic bottlenecks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>5.2 Ad Hoc Networks</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Only specialized members need to communicate with the rover, reducing bandwidth requirements and costs.</li>
        <li>Bandwidth between the rover and swarm remains constant regardless of swarm size.</li>
        <li>Task distribution can be decided within the swarm, reducing the synchronization load on the rover and saving
          developer resources.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>5.3 Challenges</h4>
      <p>A potential challenge is network partitioning if ground control fails; however, this is a non-issue, as the
        mission would be compromised without ground control. Strategies will be discussed for scenarios where only
        certain frequencies fail.</p>

      <h3>6. Communication Architecture</h3>
      <p>Each member of the swarm will be represented as a node in a graph, with <em>k</em> specialized members carrying
        radio equipment for communication with the rover (where <em>k</em> â‰¤ <em>n</em>). The swarm will utilize FANET
        to achieve intercommunication.</p>
      <img src="FANET_nodegraph.png" width="100%" alt="node graph showing different ways the FANET can work">

      <h4>6.1 Communication Requirements</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>A transmission point: a drone with direct communication to the rover.</li>
        <li>Each drone must map its assigned area to help the rover decide optimal paths, necessitating:
          <ul>
            <li>LIDAR sensors for terrain mapping.</li>
            <li>Cameras for image capture.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Considering the potential size of LIDAR data, the swarm must relay this information back to the rover in a
        timely manner. Recommended communication includes short-range, high-transmission-rate options such as 4G/5G.</p>

      <h4>6.2 Data Handling Solutions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Employ file compression and machine learning techniques for large files.</li>
        <li>Utilize deep learning for data reconstruction and interpolation.</li>
        <li>Process data onboard the drones to reduce the transmission load.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7. Data Transmission Protocols</h3>
      <p>Drones will send data to the nearest neighbor acting as a transmission point, using a handshake method to
        confirm the receipt of data packets. If a drone loses connection or has a poor data link, the swarm will adapt.
        To avoid collisions from unreachable drones, they will mitigate the issue
        by either moving on or measuring from a different spot.</p>

      <h4>7.1 Neighbor Identification</h4>
      <p>Each drone will know its coordinates relative to the target point sent by the rover. Upon reaching the target,
        the transmission point will broadcast to its neighbors. Each neighbor will save the drone identifier and
        distance to it, propagating the signal while adding to the distance. This ensures that all members know where to
        send their data, as they will remain relatively stationary until receiving new commands from the rover.</p>

      <h4>7.2 Data Interference Management</h4>
      <p>Data interference will be handled using established algorithms such as CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access
        with Collision Avoidance). The transmission delay is manageable since the transmission point requires time to
        send all data back to the rover.</p>

      <h4>7.3 Routing Protocols</h4>
      <p>The selection of routing protocols within the swarm is an actively researched area. For the purposes of this
        task:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Speed is not a primary concern.</li>
        <li>Security is not a primary concern.</li>
        <li>Reliability is essential, so any reliable routing protocol will be adequate.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>8. Conclusion</h3>
      <p>This document presents a comprehensive plan for implementing a communication system for a swarm of drones
        utilizing FANET. By leveraging ad hoc networking and effective data handling strategies, we aim to optimize
        communication, reduce resource consumption, and ensure reliable operations.</p>
