    <h3>Objective: Develop a simulation of a robot swarm exploring and mapping the Martian surface.</h3>
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>The exploration and mapping of Mars present significant challenges due to the planet's vast, rugged terrain and
      harsh
      environmental conditions. Traditional single-rover missions, while valuable, are limited in their scope and
      efficiency. The first being slow progress: careful navigation and the need to avoid hazards mean that single
      rovers
      often progress slowly, limiting the amount of terrain they can explore.</p>
    <p>The distance between Earth and Mars results in significant communication delays, ranging from 4 to 24 minutes
      one-way. This delay makes real-time control impossible and complicates problem-solving during critical mission
      phases.
    </p>
    <p>Lack of redundancy: If a single rover fails or gets stuck, the entire mission is jeopardized</p>
    <p>Slow progress:Proposed Solution</p>
    <p>To address these limitations and accelerate Martian exploration, we propose the development of a simulation
      system
      for a flying robot swarm designed to explore and map the Martian surface. Building upon NASA's innovative
      Marsbee
      concept, our simulation project aims to extend and refine the swarm exploration approach for Mars. From the
      Marsbee
      concept, the algorithm will implement resilient system design, emphasizing the robustness of the swarm to
      individual
      unit failures, and collaborative data collection, implementing algorithms for single and collaborative sample or
      data
      collection missions among swarm members.</p>
    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <h3>Martian Environment Simulation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Each robot should have basic sensing capabilities (e.g., detecting nearby objects, terrain features, and
            other
            robots).</p>

      <h3>Swarm Behavior</h3>
      <p>Implement basic swarm intelligence algorithms:</p>
      <ul>

      <h3>Visualization</h3>
      <p>Create a basic graphical interface to visualize the swarm's movement and mapping progress on the Martian
        terrain.

        <li>
          <p>Percentage of area mapped</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Time to explore key features (e.g., cave entrances)</p>

        <li>
